# My Savvy Coders Capstone Project

Hi, I’m Kris Cunningham.  I thought the best way to show my desire to change careers was to create a personal branding site.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a single page application.  I chose to use JavaScript functions and JSON files to render both sets of skills as well as my portfolio.  I am using Formspree as my email API on the contact form page.  And finally, I’m using Netlify to link and deploy my page directly from Github.
 
Throughout the build, I used several project management tools to help bring my site to life.  I used hand-drawn markups to think through the design.  I used Trello to be sure I didn’t miss any activities or actions needed.  And I used Github for my version control.

In the future, I would like to make it more mobile friendly.  And I would like to add more projects to my portfolio.  

My engineering background and being able to think systematically really became so useful during this course.  And I’m excited about continuing to learn and grow in this technical field.
